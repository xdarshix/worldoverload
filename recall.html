    <h5>What Is a Food Recall?</h5>
    <p>A food recall occurs when there is reason to believe that a food may cause consumers to become ill. A food producer initiates the recall to take foods off the market. In some situations, food recalls are requested by government agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). A product can be recalled for many reasons including but not limited to:</p>

    <p>Discovery of organisms such as bacteria like Salmonella.</p>
    <p>Discovery of foreign objects such as broken glass or metal.</p>
    <p>Discovery of a major allergen that does not appear on the product label.</p>



    <h5>What Is an Outbreak?</h5>
    When two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink, the event is called a foodborne outbreak. Public health officials investigate outbreaks to control them, so more people do not get sick in the outbreak, and to learn how to prevent similar outbreaks from happening in the future.
<h6></h6>
    When a foodborne disease outbreak is detected, public health and regulatory officials work quickly to collect as much information as possible to find out what is causing it, so they can take action to prevent more people from getting sick. This action includes warning the public when there is clear and convincing information linking illness to a contaminated food. Outbreaks may be investigated by federal, state, and local public health and regulatory officials, depending on how widespread the outbreak is.
