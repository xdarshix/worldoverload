      <strong> Vaping/Smoking/Drinking Statistics </strong>
      <p>* Vaping- The 2017 National Youth Tobacco Survey found that 11.7 percent of high school students and 3.3 percent of middle school students used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days, compared with 1.5 percent of high school and 0.6 percent of middle school students who reported current use in 2011. </p>
<p> * Smoking-
the study of more than 200,000 people, published this week in BMC medicine, found about 67 percent of smokers perished from smoking related illness. </p>
<p> * Drinking-  teen alcohol use kills 4,700 people each year. That‚Äôs more than all illegal drugs combined! </p>

<strong> Why do people do this?</strong>
<p> Fewer people are using them to quit smoking, and more people are using them to boost their social image; a new study finds on vaping. The decision to drink alcohol will depend on the value that the person attributes to drinking alcohol‚Äîto elevate positive mood, alleviate negative mood and anxiety, or increase confidence‚Äîand the person‚Äôs expectation that these outcomes will actually happen. In all, people do this based on peer-pressure, or their belief that reality will meet expectation. </p>

<h2> Vaping </h2>

<strong> Vaping in teens </strong>
<p> The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared teen use of electronic cigarettes to be at ‚Äúepidemic proportions.‚Äù <img src="ape.jpg" class="border"; style="float:right;width:352px;height:253px;"> The agency also told e-cigarette manufacturers that if they didn‚Äôt stop marketing to minors that their flavored products will be pulled from the market. Teen vaping is a concern because the developing adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to addiction.</p>

<strong> Dangers </strong>
<p>* The area of the brain responsible for emotions and controlling our wild impulses is known as the prefrontal cortex; It's very vulnerable to nicotine's effects</p>

<p> According to the 2014 Surgeon General‚Äôs Report,(SGR); about 3 out of 4 high school smokers will become adult smokers ‚Äì even if they intend to quit in a few years.</p>
<strong> Effects </strong>
<p>Smoking can cause lung disease by damaging your airways and the small air sacs (alveoli) found in your lungs; like  COPD, which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.. Cigarette smoking causes most cases of lung cancer. </p>
